This is the first post for this website, and I'm keeping it super short as a demonstration of what can go here. This website is intended to consolidate a lot of information. Hopefully this will help me keep myself organized, but I'm hoping it will also be a useful resource for Monarda taxonomy in the future if I can keep it up to date.

To start, I'm hoping to include profiles on all Monarda species (even if they are empty to start), and slowly fill them in with information and images. I will also include information about provisional taxa or particularly interesting populations.

At some point down the line I'm also hoping to include keys and identification information and citations to lots of previous taxonomic work that's already been done in this genus.
